WhoAmI
My name is Rohan Subba, and I am an Information Technology major with a strong interest in technology and continuous learning. I moved to the United States in 2015 and have focused on developing technical and professional skills. I am motivated, detail-oriented, and committed to long-term professional growth.

WorkStyle
I have a strong work ethic and approach tasks with focus and responsibility. I work well both independently and in team settings, communicate clearly, and follow instructions carefully. I am organized, reliable, and always willing to learn new skills to improve my performance.

Comms
I prefer clear and planned communication. I can answer quick questions in chat, but important or detailed topics are better in email or meetings. I work best when goals are clear and I can collaborate step by step.
